      <h1>Contribute to P2:15</h1>
      <p>
        Currently, our open-source, non-profit Bible Study App is maintained by just two
        contributors. We're a scrappy team with minimal infrastructure, so getting started might
        be a bit challenging. However, we believe this project has the potential to
        significantly help people grow closer to God, and we'd love your help to make that a
        reality.​
